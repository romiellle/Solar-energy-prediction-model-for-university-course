Solar Energy Prediction Model

This project was developed as part of a university course "Data Engineering & Data Analytics". It aims to visualize and analyse different datasets and then use them to predict the solar production in a specific week.
The project was initially done in German, which is why the data is also mostly in German. There is an English version of the project as well, which uses the same data but translates what is needed to English. 
The project was the final grade of the course and was done with a partner.
